# Machine-Learning
Several folders containing the assignments I wrote for the course machine learning during the second half of 2021.
The idea was to train several ML models on 2 datasets; one found somewhere on the internet and another one obtained using a 'twitter scraper', a script that would take a number of tweets that contained a certain hashtag and place all relevant data into a csv file that could hen be used as a dataset.

Code along with explanation and pictures can always be found in the .ipynb files (these are python notebooks containing snippets of python code)
